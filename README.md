# Music Web App

This is a simple web app that is built with React and that uses the Seyi Vibez's Bank Of America song. I got to use the Hollowjs Package that is built on top of the browser's audio API. This app showcases how much can be achieved with the component modelling of React applications.

### Icons were handled by the React icons package.
